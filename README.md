# About the Game:
This is a tower-defense style game modeled off of the mobile app Plants vs Zombies. The player’s goal is to strategically place towers that can defend from an onslaught of enemies for as long as possible.

Upon launching the game, the player is taken to a menu screen that allows them to either immediately jump into the game with the ‘Play’ button, or they can specify the level of difficulty first by clicking the ‘Options’ button. From the options screen the user can select ‘Easy’, ‘Medium’, or ‘Hard’ difficulties, with  ‘Medium’ being the default. Changing the difficulty will influence the monetary income of the player throughout the game, which while unnoticeable at first does directly impact the length of time that the player can “survive” for.
	
As for gameplay, the user interacts with the game by clicking first on the type of turret that they wish to use as a defense, and second on where in the grid system they want to place it. Turrets fire projectiles to kill enemies only within their own row, while enemies will spawn across all rows randomly. If an enemy makes it all the way from the right side of the grid to the very left, the player loses a life, subtracting from their initial 10 lives. When the player has no lives remaining, the game ends. To understand their current game state, the player can see their total money, amount of time survived for, and lives remaining in the top right of the window.

# How to Run the Game:
The main class for this project is the TowerDefenseMain class in the default package. To play the game, navigate to csci205\_final\_project/dist/Monsters vs. Plumbers.jar. Run the .jar file in whatever method you prefer, and the game should launch you to the main menu.
